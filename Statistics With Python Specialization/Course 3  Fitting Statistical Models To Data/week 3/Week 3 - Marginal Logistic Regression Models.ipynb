    "* With marginal models, there is no explicit interest in making inference about between-cluster variance in the coefficients of interest in a given model\n",
    "* GEE is a general technique for estimating marginal regression models and accounting for the within-cluster dependencies in a dependent variable introduced by cluster sampling or repeated measurements.\n",

    "Population average marginal relationships between predictor variables of interest and a binary dedpendent variable\n",
    "* Overall marginal relationship across all the clusters that may have been introduced by the study design.\n",

    "## Marginal Models for Binary Outcomes\n",
    "* GEE Models were specifically designed to **readily accomodate non-normal outcome variables measured longitudinally**\n",
    "    * So, where there are repeated measurements over time on the same subject that's being studied.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * We have reason to believe that those repeated measurements are correlated. \n",
    "* The mean structure in the estimating equation is defined by a given type of generalized linear models.\n",
    "    * In Marginal Linear Regression models we saw the mean was defined by the linear combination of the predictor variables and teh regression coefficients.\n",
    "        * That's how we modelled the mean of the normally distributed dependent variable.\n",

It's given by the exponential of the linear combination of predictive variables and regression parameters divided by 1 + the exponential of that linear combination of predictive variables and regression parameters. this is an inverse logit function that can be used to calculate a probability that the dependent variable is equal to 1 based on the specified model. <br>\n",
    "This is where the Beta parameters enter into the estimating equation. We write down the mu as given here into the equation and then we try to solve the score function for the values of those parameters.\n",

    "### Conclusion from the example\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Marginally:** when we look at the overall population average or the marginal relationships across the NHANES sampling clusters, we find the **Same estimated fixed effects** as we did when we fit the **multilevel model.**\n",
    "    * So whether we were conditioning on the random effects like we were in the multilevel case or when looking at the overall population average marginal relationship, we will reach very similar conclusion on the importance of the different predictor variables in predicting lifetime smoking behavior.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Accounting for the dependency rather than assuming independence of observations within each cluster did **not** seem to improve the model fit in this case. \n",
    "    * There was some evidence of between cluster variance in the multilevel modelling approach, that within cluster correlation did not prove to be substantial in this case.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Remember:** We still interpret the estimated fixed effects **marginally** across clusters. We are not conditioning on what's happening on a given cluster but across all the NHANES sampling clusters when the values of the predictor variables change."

    "Answer: c). We are fitting a marginal model, so our inference is averaged across the entire population of NHANES clusters (not specific to a given NHANES cluster, which would be the case when using a multilevel modeling approach). Also, when fitting a logistic regression model, remember that we are modeling the log-odds of an event occurring, and we are not modeling the probability directly.\n",
