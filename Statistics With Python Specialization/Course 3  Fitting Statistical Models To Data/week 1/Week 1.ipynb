    "# What is Fitting models to Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** How to fit **Statistical models** to **data** to help answer research questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## We do NOT fit data to Models. We fit Models to data.\n",
    "* **Fit Models:** Specify models based on theory or subject knowledge and then fit those models to the data that we collected\n",
    "* **Data:** Variables follow distributions have certain relationships and the models that we fit to the data describe those distributions or relationships\n",
    "* Fit models -> Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do we fit modedls to data?\n",
    "* **Estimate** distributional properties of variables, potentially conditional on other variables\n",
    "    * Estimate means of distributions, their variances and the quantiles of those distributional properties of variables\n",
    "* Concisely **Summerize relationships** between variables, and make inferentials statements about those relationships\n",
    "    * Relationship between a predictor and a dependent variable\n",
    "* **Predict** values of variables of interest conditional on the values of other predictior variables, and characterize the prediction uncertainty : to predict the outcomes on election, to predict the outcome of a sporting event or what's gonna happen with the weather or stock market -> focus is to predict the values of certain outcomes of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "### Focus \n",
    "* Focus on **parametric models ->** Estimating **parameters** that describe the distributions of variables\n",
    "* Given data, we suggest that a **variable of interest** follows a certain **probability model**\n",
    "    * e.g. we might assume that a continuous variable of interest like blood pressure, etc follows a normal distribution\n",
    "    * This is an example of a parametric model\n",
    "    * Estimate parameters that define that model, e.g mean in addition to the variance of that normally distributed variable\n",
    "        * These parameters define this model and we want to estimate their values in part to answer research questions\n",
    "    **Fitting a normal distribution to a given continuous variable is one way of fitting a model to the data we have collected** \n",
    "### Fitting models to data.\n",
    "We learnt in C2 how to estimate model parameters and sampling variance to **make inference about the parameters** by testing hypothesis or generating confidence intervals.\n",
    "* Example of specifying a probability model given a research question and estimating the parameters of that model\n",
    "* The idea of **Assessing model fit:** Does the model seem to fit the observed data well?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Test Performance and Age\n",
    "* Variable of interest: Test performance in the range of [0,8]\n",
    "* Possible Predictor to answer our research question: Age that is standardized in respect to mean and the standard dev of age\n",
    "* We want to predict if age can predict the value of test performance\n",
    "* Furthermore we believe that age has a **curvilinear** relationship with performance\n",
    "    * it means Modorate values of age: Performance is best\n",
    "    * and for Smaller or larger avlues of Age: Performance tends to be worse\n",
    "    * We have a working theory that defines this curvilinear relationship and we want to collect data and fit a model to that data, estimate the parameters of that model and test this working theory\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Goals:**\n",
    "1. Estimate **marginal mean** of performance across all ages so we might have a descriptive objective\n",
    "    * just estimate the average test performance regardless of age\n",
    "2. estimate mean performance **conditional** on age\n",
    "    * Then two, we wish to estimate the mean performance conditional on age. So, we wish to estimate the relationship of age with mean test performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2 different modelling approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "![introduction](../img/test-performance-and-age.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\"Mean only\" model** for test performance\n",
    "    * We wukk assume test performance follows a **normal distribution** overall defined by a particular mean and a particular variance (2 parameters).\n",
    "    * So we are estimating the mean and variance of that normal distribution\n",
    "    * we think that the normal distribution represents a good model for the observed value on test performance and we are only interested in modelling the overall mean.\n",
    "2. **Conditional on age**, we believe performance follows again a normal distribution where the mean is defined by a **quadratic function** of age, a + b * age + c * age^2 (3 parameters, a, b, and c) and variance sigma^2 (one parameter) conditioned on age, how variable is test performance given a particular value of age. So we relate test performance to age with this quadratic function and this quadratic function captures our theory of the curvilinear relationship between age and test performance   \n",
    "    * We are expecting to see an U shaped or inverse-U shaped relationship between age and test performance\n",
    "    * This is a conditional model for test performance\n",
    "    \n",
    "![introduction](../img/data-performance.png)\n",
    "    \n",
    "for the first image, We see that the distribution looks farely normal and from the Quantile Quantile plot we see that most of the points lie on the 45 degree line suggesting a normal distribution as well.\n",
    "So the normal distribution is a reasonable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![introduction](../img/data-performance-age.png)    \n",
    "\n",
    "We see that the range of standardized age lies between -3 and 4, it looks like we have an inverse U shaped plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fitting the \"Mean-Only\" model\n",

    "\n",
    "**Perf = m + e** mean + error\n",
    "\n",
    "1st parameter: unknown constant, <br>\n",

    "![introduction](../img/conditional-model-fit.png)\n",

    "a: when age = 0, i.e age = the overall mean, we'd expect the test performance to be 5.11 with se of .10 <br>\n",
    "b: the linear portion of this quadratic relationship is 0.24 with a se of 0.06 <br>\n",
    "c: it describes the acceleration of performance as a function of age or in this case, the decellaration is -0.26 with a se of 0.03 <br>\n",
    "if we see the ratios of these estimate to the standard errors just to forshadow testing hypothesis about regression coefficients, all of these will seem to be non-zero <br>\n",
    "our estimate of sigma^2 is 1.29. This is a conditional variance. Once we condition on age, how much unexplained variability is there in the test performance measures captured by those random errors. We see the curvilinear relationship that's the fit of the particular model to the observed data. Visually it looks like a good fit but we need to look at some diagnostics to see if this fit is reasonable.\n",
