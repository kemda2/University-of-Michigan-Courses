    "### Best Practices for Data Management\n",
    "1. Never modify the source data files (you want to preserve a record of the data as you received it).\n",
    "2. Write a script (e.g. a Python program) to generate your analysis files from the source data files.\n",

    "2. Short variable names convey too little meaning, and very long names are awkward to use in complex expressions\n",
    "3. Variable names consisting only of letters (a-z, case sensitive), numbers (not as the first character) and the underscore character (_) will be handled easily by most statistical software.\n",
    "4. Whitespace in variable names is allowed in Python/Pandas, but confuses analysis based on formulas. To avoid this, use (for example) \"birth_date\" instead of \"birth date\".\n",
    "5. Most statistical software will treat blank, “NA”, or “.” as a missing value."

    "### Spreadsheet Software\n",
    "1. Spreadsheet software can be useful for getting a quick overview of a data set, but is quite limited for more advanced data management and analysis.\n",

    "3. Spreadsheet graphs and charts will generally be ignored when importing spreadsheet data into statistical software.\n",
    "4. Each sheet in a spreadsheet workbook is usually imported as a separate dataset.\n",
