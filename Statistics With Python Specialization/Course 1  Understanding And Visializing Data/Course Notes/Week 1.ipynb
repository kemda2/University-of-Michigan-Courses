    "\n",
    "Data management is a crucial component to statistical analysis and data science work.  The following code will show how to import data via the pandas library, view your data, and transform your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main data structure that Pandas works with is called a **Data Frame**.  This is a two-dimensional table of data in which the rows typically represent cases (e.g. Cartwheel Contest Participants), and the columns represent variables.  Pandas also has a one-dimensional data structure called a **Series** that we will encounter when accesing a single column of a Data Frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has a variety of functions named '`read_xxx`' for reading data in different formats.  Right now we will focus on reading '`csv`' files, which stands for comma-separated values. However the other file formats include excel, json, and sql just to name a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a link to the .csv that we will be exploring in this tutorial: [Cartwheel Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-visualization-data/resources/0rVxx) (Link goes to the dataset section of the Resources for this course)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other options to '`read_csv`' that are very useful.  For example, you would use the option `sep='\\t'` instead of the default `sep=','` if the fields of your data file are delimited by tabs instead of commas.  See [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) for the full documentation for '`read_csv`'."
